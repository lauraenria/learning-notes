## Job Search Mindset

* [know what you want](https://youtu.be/cBk7bno3KS0): and only searching for role that match these requirements
    * write 3 things you cannot compromise on: example location, company mission (you want to do work you're proud of), role, guidelines/mentoring?.

* [Research to understand what the employer wants](https://youtu.be/X9JBzbrkcvs): you want to be someone who can perform the necessary job functions, and help drive the mission and goals of the company. The best employee has the tecnical proficiencies and passion the job they are doing

    * being able to connect to a company's mission is the difference between being qualified for the hob and landing the job offer. Showing that you understand what's important for to the company and you are going to do everything you can to help you drive the mission makes the employer more inclined to take a chance on you and hire you anyway.

**Types of Resume Formats**

Resume formats can be split into three categories, depending on the job candidate:

* Entry-level (about 0-3 years of experience)

* Career Change (3+ years of work experience, looking to change career paths)

* Prior Industry Experience (3+ years of work experience; looking to level up in their career path by upskilling)

## Resume Review (Entry-level)

# [Craft Your Cover Letter](https://eu.udacity.com/course/craft-your-cover-letter--ud244)

## [Purpose of the Cover Letter](https://youtu.be/7F7cMCTcyhM)

* Submit a targeted letter

* Start with "Why I am excited and passionate about this job

* Then connect how my seemingly unrelated work experiences actually are very relevant for the job duties and why this prepares me for the job.

* "I want to build my career", let them know what I'm most interested in about the job and how will help me become a better employee in the future, and to fulfill my short and long-term professional goals.

## [Cover Letter Components](https://youtu.be/DVvLiKedRw4)

Your cover letter should include the following sections:

* Heading (this can be the same as the one used for your resume)

* Introduction

* 2-3 body paragraphs

* Conclusion


[example]

In all cases, your cover letter should build a narrative highlighting your accomplishments and experiences in a way that goes beyond what your resume conveys.

## [Write the Introduction](https://youtu.be/5S5PH73WLLY)

It should include:

* my purpose and professional mission.

* Name of the organization and the title of the position you are applying to in the first paragraph

* mention if someone refers you

* Focus on why you want the company (it's vital: the best employees are excited about the company so communicate it and be specific)

If you're having trouble formulating your own "why" for applying for the job, try to keep the following in mind:

* How is the company different, special, and unique?
* Do you explain why your experiences relate to the company and the role?

## [Write the Body](https://youtu.be/aK9Qnv3a6Wg)

* focus on things you are especially good at.

* If the job asks for skills that you don't have and don't show up in your resume, use the cover letter to make a case for yourself.
    * eg talk about relevant projects

* details about your relevant qualifications and goals (a concrete example of your related experience)

* Eg.Example: describe a specific recent project and describe the languages and framework you used, how you work and what you could accomplish better

* Example on when you achieve a lot of great success or when you work on a team or with a challenge to produce something you have never done before.

* Reinforce your goal and how they align with the position.

*Adapted from: https://www.toptal.com/front-end/job-description


Remember: Cover letters are sometimes read before the resume, so the cover letter needs to be strong on its own and not just refer back to resume content. You also want to avoid making your cover letter just another version of your resume; it should bring more to the employer's understanding of you as a job candidate!

[Write the Conclusion](https://youtu.be/i3ozyhGPmIg)

* Thank you for the recruiter's briefly restate why you want and why you are a good fit for this particular job, remember to state any logistics (like if you are currently out of town and not be able to interview in person until a certain date.)me and consideration. (humility and gratitude)

* Thank you for the recruiter's time and consideration (Remember humility and gratitude).
