## Job Search Mindset

* [know what you want](https://youtu.be/cBk7bno3KS0): and only searching for role that match these requirements
    * write 3 things you cannot compromise on: example location, company mission (you want to do work you're proud of), role, guidelines/mentoring?.

* [Research to understand what the employer wants](https://youtu.be/X9JBzbrkcvs): you want to be someone who can perform the necessary job functions, and help drive the mission and goals of the company. The best employee has the tecnical proficiencies and passion the job they are doing

    * being able to connect to a company's mission is the difference between being qualified for the hob and landing the job offer. Showing that you understand what's important for to the company and you are going to do everything you can to help you drive the mission makes the employer more inclined to take a chance on you and hire you anyway.

**Types of Resume Formats**

Resume formats can be split into three categories, depending on the job candidate:

* Entry-level (about 0-3 years of experience)

* Career Change (3+ years of work experience, looking to change career paths)

* Prior Industry Experience (3+ years of work experience; looking to level up in their career path by upskilling)

## Resume Review (Entry-level)

All Resume Review Projects will guide you through updating your resume according to the conventions that recruiters expect and ensure your resume is appropriately targeted to the job you’re applying to.

Choose this project if you are an entry-level job applicant with 0-3 years experience in your field. Best suited for applicants who have recently graduated from their formal education and have limited work experience.

Resumes are required for job applications and recruiting. The most effective resumes are ones aimed at a specific job. In this project, you will find a job posting and target your resume to those job duties and requirements. Once you complete this project, you've successfully applied targeted job search strategies and are ready to look for work!

# [Craft Your Cover Letter](https://eu.udacity.com/course/craft-your-cover-letter--ud244)

## [Purpose of the Cover Letter](https://youtu.be/7F7cMCTcyhM)

* Submit a targeted letter

* Start with "Why I am excited and passionate about this job

* Then connect how my seemingly unrelated work experiences actually are very relevant for the job duties and why this prepares me for the job.

* "I want to build my career", let them know what I'm most interested in about the job and how will help me become a better employee in the future, and to fulfill my short and long-term professional goals.

## [Cover Letter Components](https://youtu.be/DVvLiKedRw4)

Your cover letter should include the following sections:

* Heading (this can be the same as the one used for your resume)

* Introduction

* 2-3 body paragraphs

* Conclusion


[example]

In all cases, your cover letter should build a narrative highlighting your accomplishments and experiences in a way that goes beyond what your resume conveys.

## [Write the Introduction](https://youtu.be/5S5PH73WLLY)

It should include:

* my purpose and professional mission.

* Name of the organization and the title of the position you are applying to in the first paragraph

* mention if someone refers you

* Focus on why you want the company (it's vital: the best employees are excited about the company so communicate it and be specific)

If you're having trouble formulating your own "why" for applying for the job, try to keep the following in mind:

* How is the company different, special, and unique?
* Do you explain why your experiences relate to the company and the role?

## [Write the Body](https://youtu.be/aK9Qnv3a6Wg)

* focus on things you are especially good at.

* If the job asks for skills that you don't have and don't show up in your resume, use the cover letter to make a case for yourself.
    * eg talk about relevant projects

* details about your relevant qualifications and goals (a concrete example of your related experience)

* Eg.Example: describe a specific recent project and describe the languages and framework you used, how you work and what you could accomplish better

* Example on when you achieve a lot of great success or when you work on a team or with a challenge to produce something you have never done before.

* Reinforce your goal and how they align with the position.

*Adapted from: https://www.toptal.com/front-end/job-description


Remember: Cover letters are sometimes read before the resume, so the cover letter needs to be strong on its own and not just refer back to resume content. You also want to avoid making your cover letter just another version of your resume; it should bring more to the employer's understanding of you as a job candidate!

[Write the Conclusion](https://youtu.be/i3ozyhGPmIg)

* Thank you for the recruiter's briefly restate why you want and why you are a good fit for this particular job, remember to state any logistics (like if you are currently out of town and not be able to interview in person until a certain date.)me and consideration. (humility and gratitude)

* Thank you for the recruiter's time and consideration (Remember humility and gratitude).

[example]


Be sure to include the following:

* A statement of thanks—"Thank you for your consideration."

* A salutation and signature—"Best Regards..." (A signature is nice-to-have, but not required.)

* Pertinent details about further communication or time-frames—"I am available to meet in person in London."


By including these key components, you **demonstrate your gratitude for the recruiter or hiring manager's time** and ensure that they **know your availability to continue this conversation** about your qualifications.

## [Format](https://youtu.be/Xlqoq-SoJso)

* Format must looks nice

* name of the recruiter if avalaible otherwise *dear engineering team* or *dear recruiting team works*

* include a formal closing salutation

## Final Advice

* **Eliminate any grammatical or spelling mistakes.** Attention to detail is important! Don't let the small yet important things jeopardize your chance of getting the job.

* **Ensure that your cover letter format is professional.** Use a clear and professional font such as Times New Roman or Verdana, standard or 1 inch margins, and ensure all paragraphs are uniformly aligned on the page. Don't let a poor format distract the recruiter or hiring manager from focusing on the content of your cover letter.

## **General**

* Answers contain no negative language

𝥷 Answers focus on thought process and approach to problems

**Hiring Perspective**: Employers will pay attention to tone and whether your approach to answering questions exudes confidence and professionalism. They want to know that the person they hire can communicate well with others, especially demonstrating an aptitude for collaboration.


Tip: It’s okay if you don’t immediately know the answer to an interview question. Try to speak without rushing, and take some time to reflect on your response before giving an answer. The key is to keep it clear and concise.


## **Targeted for Profession**

* Answer(s) relate back to job duties, referring to specific job requirements in the

   description

* Answer(s) addresses the company's mission (eg: interest in education if applying

   to an education company like Udacity)

* Answer(s) demonstrates enthusiasm for learning new skills or topics in targeted

   field

* Answers show I am ready for the role; I am passionate about the specific

   job and have the skills to succeed in the role

* Answer(s) refers to my goals within a year at the target company

* Answer(s) refers to my learning or career goals past one year from now


**Hiring Perspective**: In addition to finding someone with the skills for the job, employers want to hire candidates who are passionate and have a personal drive related to the position. These qualities are essential in a constantly evolving field, because passion for the product or field ensures that you will do your best to remain on the cutting edge.


**Tip**: Employers know that candidates won’t always fulfill every single qualification for the job—and that’s okay. When answering questions, be sure to explain why you are interested in the job and how this job aligns with your professional goals. If there are qualifications for the job that you don’t have yet, talk about any past experiences that prove you are prepared to take on learning new skills for the job.


**Technical Accuracy**

* Technical answers are correct and produce no errors

* Mentions a specific front-end framework

* Explains how framework works

* Discusses advantages and disadvantages of framework

* Compares framework to alternatives or discusses framework in context

* Gives clear, functional code that does what it’s supposed to do

* Provides detailed rationale for the code provided

* Answer is in HTML, CSS and any necessary JavaScript


**Hiring Perspective**:  Rather than focusing on whether you get the problem right, employers are more interested in seeing whether you can think like a developer and have strong problem solving abilities. **They want to hire someone who understands basic syntax, rules of the language being used, and what is actually going on with the code**. 


**Tip**: Ask clarifying questions and/or for examples before diving into code. At the whiteboard, allow for ample room to write. When writing, try to leave space between the lines in case you have to go back and add lines in the middle. Walk through the solution with 1-2 example inputs, and don’t close the tag until you’re done.
